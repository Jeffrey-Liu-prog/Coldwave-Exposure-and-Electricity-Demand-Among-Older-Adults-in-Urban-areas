# Historical Trends and Global Projections of Increased Coldwave Exposure and Electricity Demand Among Older Adults in Urban Areas
This is the code for the analysis reproduction of the manuscript titled 'Historical Trends and Global Projections of Increased Coldwave Exposure and Electricity Demand Among Older Adults in Urban Areas' for peer review. 
'Convert EC to monthly' is the key code to convert the annual EC data to the monthly level.
'Cold Wave identification' is the main code for identifying historical and future coldwave events.
'OLS regression for historical trends globally/OLS regression model for each urban settlement' is the code to build OLS models and yield the exposure trend/year and the index.
'partial correlation' is the code to implement partial correlation analysis.
'EBM regressor' is the code to train EBM models for each region and predict the EC per capita in the mid-21st century. The code also interprets models. 
'PE analysis' is the decomposition of future exposure change into the contributions of its drivers.
'EC analysis' is the code to decomposite feature contributions for changing future EC per capita data.
